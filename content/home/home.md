{{< about-section
    title="Who am I?"
    content=" <p class='lead'> As an educator, I believe that every student has the ability to succeed when given the tools and equipment to do so. I structure my classes to maximize student flexibility on summative assessments, delivering nearly all of my assessments in non-AP courses through projects with extensive student agency and reflection at every step of the process. In AP Courses, my students consistently demonstrate <a href='/blog/ap-instruction/'>mastery</a> of the subject. Overall, 95% of my students pass the AP exams and 75% receive a 4 or a 5 (84% of my AP CSA students). </p> <p class='lead'> My experience as a programmer also allows me to contribute to schools outside of the classroom. In the three most recent schools I have worked at, I have built <a href='/blog/point-trackers/'>software solutions</a> for them. In two of those cases, those tools are still in use today. My area knowledge as a teacher allows me to build software that is helpful and useful for schools. </p>"
