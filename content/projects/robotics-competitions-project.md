I have launched robotics competition teams at the MS and HS levels. Both of these teams experienced considerable success
in their first year. The HS teams have continued at SJA and have expanded considerably in their second year. In addition
to launching the teams, I have also hosted several significant tournaments on campus, which requires considerable 
logistics and planning.
