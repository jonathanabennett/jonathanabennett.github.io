I have launched robotics competition teams at the MS and HS levels. The HS teams were particularly successful, earning
two spots at the Vex World Championships (placing them in the top 5-10% of Vex teams Worldwide). These teams are very
popular within the school and require competitive tryouts to join. In addition to launching the teams, I have also 
hosted several significant tournaments on campus - including the Korean National Championship, which required 
considerable logistics and planning.
