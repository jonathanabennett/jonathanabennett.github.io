# The Results
I was one of the core members of the launch team for our school-wide Robotics Competitions program at SJA Jeju. I 
worked closely with the MS coaches to help run their teams and their tournaments in the first year and I was the HS
Robotics coach and the program coordinator for the following two years.

In that time, our program grew from approximately 15 students in Middle School only to over 50 (after tryouts) from 
6th to 12th grade. We will be adding 5th grade students next year. Not only did it grow numerically but we have
experienced a lot of success as well.

For two years in a row, our High School program has sent a team of students to represent Korea at the Vex World
Championships. Only 840 of the roughly 9,000 Vex robotics teams worldwide are able to attend each year, so earning a 
slot two years in a row is a great accomplishment.

# The Challenge
Launching a robotics program is a challenging endeavor for several reasons. Robotics programs demand a major up-front
investment of capital and continued reinvestment to remain relevant, particularly in a competition setting. Robotics 
programs also require lots of space to be successful, meaning that the competition and curricular spaces frequently 
have to be shared. Because of this, they require careful consideration about how best to structure the classroom 
environment so that the needs of the competition teams do not overwhelm the assessment needs of the classroom. While 
teaching at RIS, I launched our entire Robotics program in the MS from scratch and while teaching at SJA, I launched 
our HS competition teams. Both of these experiences have provided me with considerable experience in managing budgets, 
planning long term projects, and coordinating logistics across multiple teams.

## Budget Planning
Each of these program launches has come with budgetary considerations. In order to successfully launch and expand the
programs, I have built detailed proposals which presented the need and a range of possible price points at which we 
could meet those needs. These proposals included precise costs and reasons for each item which needed to be
purchased. When possible, it also included cheaper alternatives, where possible, and timelines which would allow us to
spread the costs out. 

These proposals ranged from roughly $15,000 for a smaller launch year up to nearly $90,000 in year for a major program 
expansion. In both schools, versions of my proposal were accepted with minimal modifications because of the detail and 
planning put into them.

## Long Term Projects
A successful robotics program, particularly a robotics competition program, is built over a series of years rather than
in a single project. Student expertise needs to be cultivated and passed on from experienced members to newer members 
from year to year so that the teams do not begin anew with each year. This development takes time and intentionality on
the part of the coaching team. In both of the teams that I have founded, experienced students have been taught to 
mentor other students. This mentoring gave newer members the skills needed to grow into strong teams.

In addition to long term team building, robotics programs also require extensive long term planning for tournaments and
leagues. Tournaments need to be booked and scheduled in the school year before they are hosted. This requires 
coordinating with multiple groups to reserve spaces, order fields and other hosting equipment, get the tournament
approval through RobotEvents, and communicate the event to other coaches so they can sign up. Having gotten other teams to
sign up, there is still planning and organization required to design the floor plan, position the fields for easy 
setup, and to coordinate with facilities to set up and tear down the event safely. Each tournament requires dozens of
adult volunteers, who need to be recruited and then trained in their roles. Each of these tournaments requires extensive
planning and setup beginning a month or more in advance of the actual date to ensure a successful event.

In my first year as robotics coordinator, I did this for two tournaments on the same day (MS and HS). The second year, 
I hosted 1 MS tournament, 1 HS league, and the HS Korean National Tournament. The Korean National Tournament,
in particular, is a large tournamen including 42 teams from all over Korea. It must be well executed, as it is a 
Qualifying Event, the results of this tournament determine which teams from Korea will be given a slot at the World 
Championship. This year, the event was held over two days and required extensive coordination with Vex and with Seoul 
Foreign School, as they are the lead school for the KAIAC league robotics teams.

## Logistics & Planning
Robotics programs require a firm grasp of logistics, planning, and organization. In the physical spaces, robotics
programs require considerable investment of time and energy in storing and organizing equipment to minimize the need
to order equipment which you already have. While this sort of logistics may seem straight forward, it can prove very
complicated for a robotics classroom. For example, Vex Robotics V5 robotics kits include 10 different lengths of screws.
They include 8 different kinds of spacers, 3 different kinds of nuts, and 2 different kinds of shaft collars. This is
before you even consider the structural components, which teams are expected to cut to the specific lengths which they
need. Without a clear organizational system, robotics programs can be extremely wasteful.

Travelling with a robotics program is even more complicated, as you need to arrange for the safe transport of fragile
robots and also so spare parts and tools to repair them. I have taken robotics students on multiple trips for 
tournaments, including two international trips to Worlds. Both of these trips, I was very careful to structure the 
trip to give the students time to check and repair damage to their robot before and after the tournament.
