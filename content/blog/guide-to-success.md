# Guiding Students to Success

Inquiry and Project Based learning are key concepts in modern pedagogy. As a
Computer Science teacher, I believe it is especially important that I align my
assessments as closely as I can to the experience that most students will have
if they become Software Engineers.

This isn't just important because it helps prepare them for future jobs, it also
helps to learn the programming langauges better. Most exercises created for CS
courses are very small. On average, they only require the students to write
10-15 lines of code. They also go out of their way to isolate the concept being
targeted.

For example, a lesson on for loops will often only require students to read,
debug, or write 4-5 code segments, each containing only a single for loop.
They may have a separate function which is called in the for loop in one of the
activities. Very few of the activities will have the students write more than
3-5 lines inside the for loop.

By comparison, in a project written in the same programming language to generate
student reports, I had 13 lines of code, several of which called out to other
10-20 line functions I had written. When looking at real projects, most programmers
would say that a small project runs 300-500 lines of code. This is two orders
of magnitude more than what students spend 80% of their time in class writing.

In my experience, this massive gap in size means students feel very comfortable
working with small code segments but struggle when they go to work on a real
project. That project may be a personal project or it may be a larger project
in university. By analogy, this is like an English class where students never
write anything longer than a paragraph. While students can learn a lot about
writing by writing shorter segments, they need to practice producing longer
form writings in order to develop those skills.

## Challenges with Projects

Larger projects come with their own challenges though, particularly projects
where students are not expected to progress through the steps in lockstep.
It is not uncommon for students to become stuck at different points in a project,
putting that student out of sync with the rest of the class. At the same time,
it isn't uncommon for students to procrastinate on large projects, leaving
themselves without enough time to turn in what the teacher is expecting.

Another issue with larger projects in the classroom is student awareness of
their own work. Estimating is an important skill when it comes to project
management and few school projects are structured to help develop this skill.
Without this, students will not be able to accurately judge the scale of the
projects they are undertaking.

The Guide to Success approach to projects aims to develop student meta
cognition about their work while also improving teacher tracking of student
progress. It has also had the fortunate side-effect of functionally eliminating
arguments with students over final project grades.

## Project Format

When using the Guide to Success format for a project, there are a few changes
from a traditional project. First, students are given full access to the
project and the rubric on Day 1 of the unit (which I always try to start on a
Monday). Second, students are assessed on the rubric at the end of each week,
even though they have not had enough time to actually complete the project.
Finally, each assessment takes place in the form of a conference rather than a
submission.

The enabling document for this is the Guide to Success. An example Guide to
Success is linked here. This Guide is for a Web Design Foundations project near
the middle of the semester and is illustrative of a typical Guide to Success.

### The Guide to Success

The Guide to success is broken into 4 sections: Task Requirements, Qualitative
Criteria, Self Reflection, and Teacher Guidance. Each of these form a key component
of the framework.

#### Task Requirements

Task Requirements represent the minimum a student can do and consider themselves
"finished". This section should have all quantitative measurements for the project
(cite x number of sources, uses y different HTML tags, etc). Students who cannot
check all the boxes in this section at the end of the project **_receive an incomplete._**

It is important that these checkboxes represent true minima. If there is something
here which you would allow a student to omit in a submission, it does not belong
here. Instead, it should be part of the next section. The things here should be
what a student would have to do in order to attempt mastery of the standards and
content.

When completing this document for an assignment, the students should check the
boxes based on their progress through the task and the teacher should verify
that they have, in fact, completed the tasks.

#### Qualitative Criteria

Qualitative Criteria represent the things which you are actually grading on the
assignment. This can be any scale you want, I found 4 to be too small. As you can
see, I am currently using 6 but I will try 10 for the next iteration. It is best
if this is an even number as it does not allow an "exactly in the middle" rating.

You will notice that I did not include any descriptors in my qualitative criteria.
Instead, I have built left space for reasoning. As with the task requirements,
the student should mark their grade (I have mine highlight the grade they think
they have earned) and then write their reasoning below. I encourage mine to write
this as bullet points and to provide links to external evidence (such as specific
line numbers in their project for my programming projects). The teacher should
also grade the project, quickly during the conference for a check-in and in detail
during the final project grading.

See the section on each for more details.

#### Self-Reflection

The whole objective of this process is to draw out student reflection on their
progress and understanding of the topic and requirements. The Self-Reflection
section should be considered mandatory **even on the final submission.** It is
the time when the students actually learn what they have learned on the project.
It is broken into 4 sections.

1. What's going well. This is a space for students to brag about their work and
   reflect on their successes.
2. What need work. This is a space for students to analyze the work they've
   already done and consider where their existing work needs improvement. This
   is **not** for describing new work.
3. What to do next. This is a space for students to reflect on next steps and
   new things to add to their project.
4. Questions for the Teacher. This is for students to ask clarifying questions.
   This is the only space where I allow perfunctory responses like "None".

Each section contains some example questions or prompts, but they can ignore those
and answer independently. I encourage students to write 1-2 bullets or sentences
for each one. The teacher reads these together with the student during conferences
and uses the responses to springboard the conversation.

#### Teacher Feedback

This is space for the teacher to provide feedback to the student. Frequently, I
will have the student write this on their own during the conference rather than
writing it myself. That tends to give them deeper understanding and ownership
of the feedback.

### The Weekly Cycle

These projects are built on a weekly cycle. My classes are largely conference
driven, with very little mass direct instruction. Instead, instruction is given
to individual students during conferences, which I aim to have at least twice a
week (depending on class size). The conferences are different lengths,
depending on the needs of the student, but generally are 3-5 minutes each. In
that conference, we discuss where they are in the coursework, where they are in
the project (which they work on concurrently with the coursework), and what
challenges or misunderstandings they may be facing. These discussions are freewheeling
and involve whiteboarding sessions, coding examples, physical examples, and
other strategies to draw out students. I plan to write about these in future
posts.

The Friday conference is different. First of all, it tends to be a little
shorter because everybody has to conference on either Thursday or Friday and
students tend to procrastinate. But more importantly, it is a graded check-in.
As our school uses traditional grading, this is scored as a quiz. The students
fill out a Guide to Success documenting their progress on the project up to
that point. They check the relevant boxes and grade their work based on what
they have finished.

Early in a project, students typically have very low grades on their check-ins.
This is to be expected and is encouraged, the check-in is structured so a low,
accurate grade does not hurt them.
