# Guiding Students to Success

Inquiry and Project Based learning are key concepts in modern pedagogy. As a
Computer Science teacher, I believe it is especially important that I align my
assessments as closely as I can to the experience that most students will have
if they become Software Engineers.

This isn't just important because it helps prepare them for future jobs, it
also helps to learn the programming languages better. As we discussed in my
previous post, most exercises created for CS courses are very small. On
average, they only require the students to write 10-15 lines of code. They also
go out of their way to isolate the concept being targeted.

While this is great for the early stages of learning a programming language,
most students can grow beyond the level where this is helpful very quickly with
a bit of practice. Therefore, all of my classes other than AP CSA are
structured so that 70-90% of the grade in that class is earned via projects -
ideally projects spanning 4-6 weeks

## Challenges with Projects

Larger projects come with their own challenges though, particularly projects
where students are not expected to progress through the steps in lockstep (or
possibly even not in the same order). It is not uncommon for students to become
stuck at different points in a project, putting that student out of sync with
the rest of the class. At the same time, it isn't uncommon for students to
procrastinate on large projects, leaving themselves without enough time to turn
in what the teacher is expecting.

Another issue with larger projects in the classroom is student awareness of
their own work. Estimating is an important skill when it comes to project
management and few school projects are structured to help develop this skill.
Without this, students will not be able to accurately judge the scale of the
projects they are undertaking.

A final challenge with projects is that they can easily devolve into a mere
box-ticking exercise. For example, consider the AP CS Principles Create Task.
The Create Task is, theoretically, a project based learning experience where
students create an application with "real world application". Unfortunately, my
experience of seeing students do this project suggest that actually doing a
project with "real world application" means you'll probably struggle to earn
all of the points. The easiest way to earn the points is instead to create a
variable that holds a list, as the user a question, then loop over the list
with an if statement until you find a match to the user's response and output
a. That may sound challenging if you have no programming experience, but in
reality that is only about 10 lines of code (plus however many items you decide
to put into the list). See again my points on the length of real programming
projects. Students prioritizing the project over the rubric will receive a lower
grade than those who simply tick all the boxes on the rubric. But a student who
actually completes a real project has learned far more about programming that
someone who merely ticked all the boxes.

The Guide to Success approach to projects aims to develop student meta
cognition about their work, improve teacher tracking of student progress, and
move the box-ticking component of the project as far away from the grading as
possible. It has also had the fortunate side-effect of functionally eliminating
arguments with students over final project grades.

## Guiding Students to Success

The Guide to Success could be applied to any project structure, but I have
found it works best when used inside the structure I've outlined in this
series. Students are given the project and rubric at the beginning of the
project and students are expected to make steady progress on the project for
the entire length of the unit rather than lumping all the work up at the end.
The Weekly Check-in process as part of the Guide to Success is a key part of
that. Without regular check-ins, the Guide to Success **will not work**. I have
found weekly to be the right balance allowing students time to make real
progress and catching students starting to fall behind, but it depends on the
length of your projects. I would recommend a minimum of 2 check-ins during a
project.

### The Guide to Success

The Guide to success is broken into 4 sections: Task Requirements, Qualitative
Criteria, Self Reflection, and Teacher Guidance. Each of these form a key component
of the framework.

#### Task Requirements

Task Requirements represent the minimum a student can do and consider
themselves "finished". This section should have all quantitative measurements
for the project (the box-ticking component of the project). Students who cannot
check all the boxes in this section at the end of the project **_should receive
an incomplete._**

It is important that these checkboxes represent true minima. If there is something
here which you would allow a student to omit in a submission, it does not
belong here. For example, if you would accept an essay that did not cite any
sources, you should not include citations in your Task Requirements. Instead,
it should be part of the next section. The things here should be what a student
would have to do in order to attempt mastery of the standards and content.

When completing this document for a check-in, the students should check the
boxes based on their progress through the task and the teacher should verify
that they have, in fact, completed the tasks.

#### Qualitative Criteria

Qualitative Criteria represent the things which you are actually grading on the
assignment. This can be any scale you want, I found 4 to be too small. As you can
see, I am currently using 6 but I will try 10 for the next iteration. It is best
if this is an even number as it does not allow an "exactly in the middle" rating.

You will notice that I did not include any descriptors in my qualitative
criteria. Instead, I have asked the students for their reasoning. As with the
task requirements, the student should mark their grade (I have mine highlight
the grade they think they have earned) and then write their reasoning below. I
encourage mine to write this as bullet points and to provide links to external
evidence (such as specific line numbers in their project for my programming
projects). The teacher should also grade the project, quickly during the
conference for a check-in and in detail during the final project grading.

#### Self-Reflection

The whole objective of this process is to draw out student reflection on their
progress and understanding of the topic and requirements. The Self-Reflection
section should be considered mandatory **even on the final submission.** It is
the time when the students actually learn what they have learned on the project.
It is broken into 4 sections.

1. What's going well. This is a space for students to brag about their work and
   reflect on their successes.
2. What need work. This is a space for students to analyze the work they've
   already done and consider where their existing work needs improvement. This
   is **not** for describing new work.
3. What to do next. This is a space for students to reflect on next steps and
   new things to add to their project.
4. Questions for the Teacher. This is for students to ask clarifying questions.
   This is the only space where I allow perfunctory responses like "None".

Each section contains some example questions or prompts, but they can ignore those
and answer independently. I encourage students to write 1-2 bullets or sentences
for each one. The teacher reads these together with the student during conferences
and uses the responses to springboard the conversation.

#### Teacher Feedback

This is space for the teacher to provide feedback to the student. Frequently, I
will have the student write this on their own during the conference rather than
writing it myself. That tends to give them deeper understanding and ownership
of the feedback.

### Creating Qualitative Criteria

My goal for each qualitative criteria is that it is a question centered on an
adjective related to how well they have either used the programming construct
or built their project. For my projects, most of the assessment is actually
connected to project quality rather than the use of specific programming
constructs. I require them to a `for` loop in the Task Requirements. Then I
assess them on their explanation of _why_ they used that for loop in their
actual grade. This shifts the emphasis from "I have to have a for loop" to "I
have to have a _useful_ for loop."

This is essential to writing good programs because good programs are not about
the programming constructs they are made of, they are about the user
experience. This is why the emphasis needs to be on the user experience. This
means that **on paper**, I heavily assess just a few of the CSTA standards
(3A-AP-19, 3A-AP-21, 3A-AP-23, and 3A-IC-25). The other standards are assessed,
but many of them are assessed as Task Requirements rather than qualitatively.
