# Role Description
This was a 50% teaching / 50% Tech Integrationalist role. In addition to teaching the Computer Science classes
for Early Years to Key Stage 2 classes, I was also responsible for computer maintenance and support and for
staff training in Ed Tech.

# Google Administrator
I was one of two administrators for our Google Apps for Education workspace. Specifically, I was responsible
for handling student accounts during our Chromebook rollout. I also managed Chrome extensions and other
components. During this time, I received the Google Certified Admin Level 2 certification.

# Chromebook Rollout
I was tasked with writing our proposal for a one-to-one Chromebook program and then for implementing the
rollout once it was done. I selected the Chromebooks, considering budgetary and maintenance considerations,
I then drafted a proposal for our business and administration team. Finally, when they arrived, I was 
responsible for imaging them, setting them up, training teachers on their use, and maintaining them when
students had issues.

# Teacher Training
I led multiple teacher trainings on Google tools ranging from Chromebooks to Gmail to Google Docs, including workshops to help teachers prepare for their Google Certified Educator level 2 certifications. During this
time, two of my presentations to staff were turned into presentations at the Google AppSummit conference.
