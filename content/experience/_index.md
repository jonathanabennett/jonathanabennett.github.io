With 15 years of experience in International Education and 20+ years of experience in programming, I have
experience across a broad array of skills and competencies.

Over the years, I have developed multiple web-based tools for schools where I have worked. I have also built
numerous personal tools in a variety of languages. This experience gives me a unique perspective on teaching
computer science.

My classes are focused on providing an experiences which mimic real projects as closely as possible, informed
by the real projects I have personally worked on. These experiences produce students who can build strong
portfolios of real projects, strengthening their college applications and their future job applications.

Additionally, I have had the opportunity to step into several teacher training and leadership roles,
particularly during my time at St. Johnsbury Academy Jeju. These opportunities have given me numerous 
opportunities to develop presentation and leadership skills.
