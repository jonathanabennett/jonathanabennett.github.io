# STEAM Department Growth
I was hired at this position to expand their existing Computer Science program. Over the course of my first year, the
student enrollment in STEAM courses more than doubled, requiring us to expand the department from 1.5 full time
equivalent positions 3 full time teachers, where it remains.

This led directly to the creation of a K-12 STEAM Coordinator role at the school, which I have filled since its
creation. In this role, I have led our school's efforts to vertically align our STEAM curriculum as we prepare for our
NEASC accreditation. In addition, I have been involved in refreshing our 3D printer and laser cutter fleets. This has
involved looking closely at local providers and equipment to ensure that teachers have equipment which does not need
constant servicing by the teacher.

# CS Honor Society
In my first year, I also founded the first international chapter of the CS Honor Society, providing an outlet for
students to use their knowledge and mastery of Computer Science to help the community. Over the 3 years of our program,
students have logged hundreds of hours and built multiple web-based programs for communities within the school to help
meet their needs. Examples include:

- An English translation of the school lunch menu, translated and updated automatically from the vendor's website
- A Service Hours tracker to allow students in NHS, CSHS, and other societies to track and submit service hours easily.

We have also run a STEAM Faire every CS Education Week, in which the students of CSHS lead the way in showcasing student
work and accomplishment from all divisions in STEAM classes. This faire is open to the public and the guides within it
are all members of CSHS.

# Robotics
In addition to Computer Science, I have also played a key role in the expansion of their robotics competition program.
I am the founding head coach for our High School teams and we successfully hosted three tournaments our first year,
requiring extensive planning and logistical coordination with our athletics, facilities, and student volunter teams.

Our first year as a team, students from our program won the Korean National Tournament, earning themselves a space at 
the 2024 Vex World Championships in Dallas, TX. As part of my role, I chaperoned our school's first trip to the US,
bringing 6 students to Dallas for a week.

In our second year, we will be hosting 4 tournaments again, as well a running a League between 4 other schools in our
athletics league. I have expanded the program greatly through capital investments and also through training coaches to
provide high quality coaching and mentoring for our teams. I am also a certified Event Partner, meaning I an certified
to host Vex Tournaments at any level. I have developed a plan for our school to apply to host a Signature Event 
(a prestigious tournament category within Vex which requires extensive planning and coordination).
