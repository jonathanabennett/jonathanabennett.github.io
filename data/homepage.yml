    I am an international educator with 14 years of experience in education and more than 25 years of experience 
    programming. I am the K-12 STEAM Coordinator at <a target='_blank' href="https://sjajeju.kr">St. Johnsbury Academy Jeju</a>. 
    I am interested in a role which will allow me to build or work with a high level robotics competition program and 
    have a larger impact on the role of technology in a school.<br>

  content: >
    <p class="lead">
      As an educator, I believe that every student has the ability to succeed when given the tools and equipment to do
      so. I structure my classes to maximize student flexibility on summative assessments, delivering nearly all of my
      assessments in non-AP courses through projects with extensive student agency and reflection at every step of the
      process. In AP Courses, my students consistently demonstrate mastery of the subject. Overall, 95% of my students
      pass the AP exams and 75% receive a 4 or a 5.
    </p>

      My experience as a programmer also allows me to contribute to schools outside of the classroom. In the previous
      three schools I have worked at, I have built software solutions for that school. In two of those cases, those 
      tools are still in use today. My area knowledge as a teacher allows me to build software that is helpful and
      useful for schools.

But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
